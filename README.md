# Hotel

This project serves as an example of a microservices application applying the following techniques:

- Hexagonal Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- SOLID Principles

The project comprises a set of microservices representing different business domains. Each microservice is responsible for a specific part of the system and is isolated from other microservices.

## Key Techniques Used

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ensures that the microservices are testable and have low coupling.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Defines the business domain and the concepts used by the microservices.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Ensures code quality and test coverage.

- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separates commands and queries to enable scalability and flexibility.

- **SOLID Principles**: Ensures code quality and ease of maintenance.
